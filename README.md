# Triangle Tracker.

## Description.
The triangle tracker is a website that allows users to enter three values and determines if it is a triangle or not. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (equilateral, isosceles, scalene).

#### By **Ivy Nzioka**

## Working of the website.
The project runs on a browser,It is a calculator that is configured to take in three values and by using the javascript if and else if statement it can find out if the triangle is equilateral,scalene,or isosceles or if not a triangle at all.

|Input of two equal values |6,8,8 |Isosceles Triangle|
|Input of three equal values |9,9,9 |Equilateral Triangle|
|Input of two sides than are not greater than the third|1,2,3|Not a triangle|
